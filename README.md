# Microservice
Approach to build microservice app using Docker

This project is an experiment and "learning material" for microservice application development. As an example, decided to build small blog web application.

Starting this project I had only basic understanding of microservices. This project is attempt to undersand and extend own knowledge about microservices, plus, in the end, to have a sketeleton project for creating microservice applications.

## TODO
**Stage 1.**
- [ ] Define structure of application
- [ ] What is needed for application setup
- [ ] Which docker container are needed
- [ ] How many containers should be
- [ ] How to manage connection betwin containers
